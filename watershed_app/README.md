# ðŸ’§ Interactive Watershed Segmentation with Marker Drawing

This project provides an interactive **image segmentation app** using the **Watershed algorithm**. Users can upload an image and **draw foreground and background markers** directly on it to guide the segmentation process. Built with **Streamlit**, **OpenCV**, and **Drawable Canvas**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

1. Upload an image.
2. Draw with **red** color to mark the object (foreground).
3. Draw with **blue** color to mark the background.
4. Press "Run Watershed" to segment the object.
5. See the segmented result with boundaries in **red**.
